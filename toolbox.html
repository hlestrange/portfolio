    <p>A central hub built for sales organization employees to access a suite of sales tools, featuring an easily accessible support portal that allows for simplified and speedy communication.

        <h4>The Challenge</h4>
        <p>
          This redesign was initiated to make the hub easier to use, to align it visually with the apps within the hub, and to alleviate the pain of submitting a support ticket. Users had trouble finding the support portal and often didn't supply enough information for the support team to diagnose the problem. The primary constraints included a short timeline and a very limited cross-functional team.

      <div class="col-sm-4 case-study-text">
        <h4>The Process</h4>
        <p>
          I worked with a Product Manager and Content Strategist to complete this project. My deliverables were wireframes, prototypes, and comps. I facilitated in-person usability testing and documented research findings.

        <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
        <p>
          Without any time for usability testing or access to Software Engineers while creating the concept, it was difficult to validate whether a decision was the right one. The positive outcome is that we were able to move very quickly, and now have the ability to go back and analyze the effect of our redesign.

      <p>The redesign of the Sales Toolbox was initiated to solve the issue of confusing navigation and frustrating user experience. The result is a simple interface that highlights the tools and provides the user with easy access to secondary actions like changing their password.</p>

      <p>The concept for the support portal redesign works to solve several pain points within the support process. By asking for just the right amount of information up front, the support team can swiftly diagnose the problem, leading to a quick solve and a less frustrated customer.</p>
